The Incident Alarm

Created by Daniel Baigel

To the best of my knowledge, everything has been implemented correctly.

I spent ~15 hours on this assignment.

I collaborated with Becky Cutler, Michael Jacobson, and Zach Kirsch




1. The heuristics used in this assignment are good for catching incidents 
   on an unencrypted network. However, if the network is encrypted then
   this method won't actually work.

2. If I had spare time in the future, I would add more credit card checks
   because there are definitely going to be credit card numbers that are
   leaked that my program doesn't detech (i.e. cards with or without '-').
   Also I would add username and password detection!
